      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        👋 Yo, I'm a tech enthusiast! Passionate about problem-solving, always
        looking for opportunities to level up my skills 🚀 <br />
        <br /> I know my way around data structures, algorithms, and software
        design 🤓 And I'm a team player who can learn fast 💪 <br />
        <br /> Hire me as your software engineer, and we'll make some awesome
        tech together! 🙌
      </p>

      <h3>Interests</h3>
      <p>
        Listen up, amigos! ⚽ I'm a massive Barca fan and I'll never pass up a
        chance to throw some shade at those Madrid losers 😜 <br />
        <br /> When I'm not busy cheering on my beloved soccer team, you can
        find me roller blading like a boss and hanging out with my squad. 🛹
        <br />
        <br /> But let's be real, nothing beats geeking out on my trusty
        computer and going on some epic gaming adventures. 🤓 And don't even get
        me started on Fortnite - that game is straight-up garbage, yo! 🗑️ <br />
        <br /> If you wanna join me in some real battle royale action, come play
        Apex Legends with me! It's the hottest game in town, and I'll show you
        how it's done. 👑
